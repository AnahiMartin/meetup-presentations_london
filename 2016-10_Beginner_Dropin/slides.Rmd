## What's R?

In origin was __S__, a programming language for statistical computing and interactive graphics. It was developed by John Chambers, Rick Becker and Allan Wilks of (NOKIA) Bell Laboratories in 1976. 

<!--- At that time statistical computing was done by directly calling Fortran subroutines; however, S was designed to offer an alternate and more interactive approach. -->

S went through many version updates (1-4, 5 plus...) until in 1992 Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman (University of Auckland, New Zealand) worked on a further implementation and renamed it __R__.

<!--- There are some differences (e.g. in S y_2 is equal to y=2, in R y_2 is just a string/object), but much of the code written for S runs unaltered in R. -->

R is currently developed by the __R Development Core Team__, of which Chambers is a member. It is a Free Software, available under a GNU General Public License. It compiles and runs on a wide variety of platforms (including Linux, Windows and MacOS).

<!--- The project was conceived in 1992, with an initial version released in 1995 and a stable beta version in 2000. -->

# Let's install the software

## Install R

Go to the R-project website, download and install R: 

[https://www.r-project.org/](https://www.r-project.org/)

The default Graphical User Interface (GUI) is basically a console!

![RGui in Windows](images/Rconsole.png) ![R in Linux/Mac](images/Rlinux.png)

## Your turn!

> - Open an R instance
> - Top line in the opening message: __R version number (release date) and name__
> - Try the functions __license()__, __help()__ and __q()__ 
> - Use R as a basic calculator (+ - / \*): 2 \* 3 
> - You can assign a value to a variable using either __<-__ or __=__
> - Define variable 'a' equal to 1: a <- 1
> - Define variable 'b' equal to 3 and calculate 'a+b': b <- 3; a+b
> - Note the semicolon (;) is used to concatenate multiple operations in one line.
> - __Let's face it, using R from console is not very appealing! For complex operations you need to have an editor, check your environmental variables, visualise plots without switching window...that's why we use RStudio!__ 

<!--- Show where to find R version number and name, basic instructions. Point out limitations of using an R console vs an IDE like RStudio. Ctrl-L to clear the console. -->

## Install RStudio

RStudio is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) specifically designed for the R language.

Go to the RStudio website, download and install R: 

RStudio [https://www.rstudio.com/](https://www.rstudio.com/) <br><br> product -> Rstudio -> Desktop -> Open Source Edition<br>

![RStudio](images/RStudio.png)

## Pre-installed packages

The basic R installation comes with a number of pre-installed packages (e.g. base, graphics, stats...). A package is a container of functions, for instance the functions c() and mean() are in the __base__ package, plot() is in the __graphics__ package, ect.

```{r, eval = TRUE, fig.height=3}
x <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)
mean(x)

plot(x)
```

## Install additional packages

There are ~8000 R packages available on the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN). 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Install a new package for advanced graphics
install.packages("ggplot2")

# Load the package
library("ggplot2")
```

## Need help? R documentation pages, Rseek and Stackoverflow

How to get to the in-built help pages
```{r} 
?boxplot 
```

Other ways to find help:

> - Browse [http://rseek.org/](http://rseek.org/) to find out what packages are available for a given topic (e.g. cluster analysis)

> - If you get stuck, Google is your friend!

> - If that doesn't work, post a question on [http://stackoverflow.com/](http://stackoverflow.com/)!

## Setting your working directory

Check where your working directory is- this is the location where all files and functions will be read and written to

```{r}
getwd()
```

If this isn't where your files are then you can set it through (put your own path in the quotes!)

```{r eval=FALSE} 
setwd("C:\Documents\mypath") 
```

Or in Rstudio you can go: Session>Set Working Directory>Choose Directory and navigate to your folder

## Load & explore a dataset

Have a look at the in-built data sets in R
```{r eval=FALSE}
data()
```

## Look at the in-built data set on trees

```{r eval=TRUE}
trees
```

## Explore the trees data set

The top of the data 
```{r} 
head(trees)
```

The end of the data set 
```{r} 
tail(trees) 
```

The size and type of the data 
```{r} 
str(trees) 
```

Summary statistics on each of the fields 
```{r} 
summary(trees) 
```

Pull out only one of the fields 
```{r} 
summary(trees$Girth) 
```

## Basic plots

Create your first plot
```{r, eval=TRUE}
boxplot(trees)
```

## Basic plots

Create another variable with only one of the fields and plot that
```{r, eval=TRUE, fig.height=4}
treeGirth <- trees$Girth
boxplot(treeGirth, xlab="Girth (units)", title="Tree Girths")
```

## Import data from a csv file

It would be best if you can get your own data and start exploring that.
Make sure that your working directory is set to your file's location
```{r eval=FALSE} 
data <- read.csv("myfile.csv")
```
